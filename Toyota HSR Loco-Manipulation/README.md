<p>Reproduction and real-world deployment of a previously published language-conditioned loco-manipulation system on the Toyota HSR at the Oxford Robotics Institute.</p>

<p>The system interprets a natural language instruction (e.g., selecting a specific object from multiple candidates), navigates to the object, grasps it, and delivers it to a user-designated location.</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Restored and adapted the codebase for execution on updated hardware and software</li>
  <li>Rebuilt PyTorch from source for newer GPU architecture</li>
  <li>Resolved CUDA and driver compatibility issues</li>
  <li>Refactored perception and control interfaces for updated HSR setup</li>
  <li>Debugged integration across vision, planning, and manipulation modules</li>
</ul>

<p>The system was successfully deployed and validated on the physical robot.</p>
